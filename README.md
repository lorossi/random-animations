# Random Animations

[Try them here](https://lorossi.github.io/random-animations).

Also, don't forget to check my [Instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/lorossi97/) where I am gradually posting all these dumb videos.

## Why?

I made this repo because I grew tired of making a separate repo for every silly JS canvas that I make.
Often there's not much to say about these animations, so when I'll feel like they are ready to go, I'll just put a link to them here along with a short description and a link to the Instagram post.

Also, sometimes I want to quickly play around or thinker with an idea that I just had or with something that I know it's not worth creating a whole repository for.

All the animations are hosted on a simple GitHub Pages website; however, some of them are very CPU intensive so be careful as your browser might freeze while opening them.
