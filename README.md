# Random Animations

I made this repo because I grew tired of making a separate repo for every silly js canvas that I make.
Often there's not much to say about these animations, so I'll just put a link to them here along with a short description and a link to the Instagram post.

All the animations are hosted on a simple GitHub Pages website; however, some of them are very CPU intensive so be careful as your browser might freeze while opening them.
